## Source Text

GPT excels at answering questions, but only on topics it remembers from its training data.
What should you do if you want GPT to answer questions about unfamiliar topics? E.g.,

Recent events after October 2023 for GPT 4 series models
Your non-public documents
Information from past conversations
etc.

This notebook demonstrates a two-step Search-Ask method for enabling GPT to answer questions using a library of reference text.

Search: search your library of text for relevant text sections
Ask: insert the retrieved text sections into a message to GPT and ask it the question

Via model weights (i.e., fine-tune the model on a training set)
Via model inputs (i.e., insert the knowledge into an input message)

Although fine-tuning can feel like the more natural option—training on data is how GPT learned all of its other knowledge, after all—we generally do not recommend it as a way to teach the model knowledge. Fine-tuning is better suited to teaching specialized tasks or styles, and is less reliable for factual recall.
As an analogy, model weights are like long-term memory. When you fine-tune a model, it’s like studying for an exam a week away. When the exam arrives, the model may forget details, or misremember facts it never read.
In contrast, message inputs are like short-term memory. When you insert knowledge into a message, it’s like taking an exam with open notes. With notes in hand, the model is more likely to arrive at correct answers.
One downside of text search relative to fine-tuning is that each model is limited by a maximum amount of text it can read at once:

ModelMaximum text lengthgpt-4o-mini128,000 tokens (~384 pages)gpt-4o128,000 tokens (~384 pages)
Continuing the analogy, you can think of the model like a student who can only look at a few pages of notes at a time, despite potentially having shelves of textbooks to draw upon.
Therefore, to build a system capable of drawing upon large quantities of text to answer questions, we recommend using a Search-Ask approach.

Text can be searched in many ways. E.g.,

Lexical-based search
Graph-based search
Embedding-based search

This example notebook uses embedding-based search. Embeddings are simple to implement and work especially well with questions, as questions often don’t lexically overlap with their answers.
Consider embeddings-only search as a starting point for your own system. Better search systems might combine multiple search methods, along with features like popularity, recency, user history, redundancy with prior search results, click rate data, etc. Q&A retrieval performance may also be improved with techniques like HyDE, in which questions are first transformed into hypothetical answers before being embedded. Similarly, GPT can also potentially improve search results by automatically transforming questions into sets of keywords or search terms.

Specifically, this notebook demonstrates the following procedure:

Collect: We’ll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics
Chunk: Documents are split into short, mostly self-contained sections to be embedded
Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API
Store: Embeddings are saved (for large datasets, use a vector database)

Given a user question, generate an embedding for the query from the OpenAI API
Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query

Insert the question and the most relevant sections into a message to GPT
Return GPT’s answer

Costs
Because GPT models are more expensive than embeddings search, a system with a decent volume of queries will have its costs dominated by step 3.

For gpt-4o, considering ~1000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.0025 per query, or ~450 queries per dollar (as of Nov 2024)
For gpt-4o-mini, using ~1000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.00015 per query, or ~6000 queries per dollar (as of Nov 2024)

Of course, exact costs will depend on the system specifics and usage patterns.

Importing the necessary libraries
Selecting models for embeddings search and question answering

# imports
import ast  # for converting embeddings saved as strings back to arrays
from openai import OpenAI # for calling the OpenAI API
import pandas as pd  # for storing text and embeddings data
import tiktoken  # for counting tokens
import os # for getting API token from env variable OPENAI_API_KEY
from scipy import spatial  # for calculating vector similarities for search

# create a list of models
GPT_MODELS = ["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini"]
# models
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))
Troubleshooting: Installing libraries
If you need to install any of the libraries above, run pip install {library_name} in your terminal.
For example, to install the openai library, run:
pip install openai
(You can also do this in a notebook cell with !pip install openai or %pip install openai.)
After installing, restart the notebook kernel so the libraries can be loaded.
Troubleshooting: Setting your API key
The OpenAI library will try to read your API key from the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. If you haven’t already, you can set this environment variable by following these instructions.
Motivating example: GPT cannot answer questions about current events
Because the training data for gpt-4o-mini mostly ended in October 2023, the models cannot answer questions about more recent events, such as the 2024 Elections or recent games.
For example, let’s try asking ‘How many ?’:
# an example question about the 2022 Olympics
query = 'Which athletes won the most number of gold medals in 2024 Summer Olympics?'

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {'role': 'system', 'content': 'You answer questions about the 2024 Games or latest events.'},
        {'role': 'user', 'content': query},
    ],
    model=GPT_MODELS[0],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
I'm sorry, but I don't have information on the outcomes of the 2024 Summer Olympics, including which athletes won the most gold medals. My training only includes data up to October 2023, and the Olympics are scheduled to take place in Paris from July 26 to August 11, 2024. You might want to check the latest updates from reliable sports news sources or the official Olympics website for the most current information.
In this case, the model has no knowledge of 2024 and is unable to answer the question. In a similar way, if you ask a question pertaining to a recent political event (that occured in Nov 2024 for example), GPT-4o-mini models will not be able to answer due to its knowledge cut-off date of Oct 2023.
# an example question about the 2024 Elections
query = 'Who won the elections in the US in 2024?'

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {'role': 'system', 'content': 'You answer questions about the 2024 Games or latest events.'},
        {'role': 'user', 'content': query},
    ],
    model=GPT_MODELS[1],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
I'm sorry, but I don't have information on events or elections that occurred after October 2023. For the latest updates on the 2024 US elections, I recommend checking reliable news sources.
You can give GPT knowledge about a topic by inserting it into an input message
To help give the model knowledge of curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics, we can copy and paste the top half of a relevant Wikipedia article into our message:
# text copied and pasted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics
# We didn't bother to clean the text, but GPT will still understand it
# Top few sections are included in the text below

wikipedia_article = """2024 Summer Olympics

The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Les Jeux Olympiques d'été de 2024), officially the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad (French: Jeux de la XXXIIIe olympiade de l'ère moderne) and branded as Paris 2024, were an international multi-sport event held from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in France, with several events started from 24 July. Paris was the host city, with events (mainly football) held in 16 additional cities spread across metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the second-largest city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea, as well as one subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.[4]

Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both bids were praised for their high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the games in 1908, 1948, and 2012).[5][6] Paris 2024 marked the centenary of Paris 1924 and Chamonix 1924 (the first Winter Olympics), as well as the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first with this distinction since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games returned to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Paris 2024 featured the debut of breaking as an Olympic sport,[7] and was the final Olympic Games held during the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach.[8] The 2024 Games were expected to cost €9 billion.[9][10][11] The opening ceremony was held outside of a stadium for the first time in modern Olympic history, as athletes were paraded by boat along the Seine. Paris 2024 was the first Olympics in history to reach full gender parity on the field of play, with equal numbers of male and female athletes.[12]

The United States topped the medal table for the fourth consecutive Summer Games and 19th time overall, with 40 gold and 126 total medals.[13]
China tied with the United States on gold (40), but finished second due to having fewer silvers; the nation won 91 medals overall.
This is the first time a gold medal tie among the two most successful nations has occurred in Summer Olympic history.[14] Japan finished third with 20 gold medals and sixth in the overall medal count. Australia finished fourth with 18 gold medals and fifth in the overall medal count. The host nation, France, finished fifth with 16 gold and 64 total medals, and fourth in the overall medal count. Dominica, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde and Albania won their first-ever Olympic medals, the former two both being gold, with Botswana and Guatemala also winning their first-ever gold medals.
The Refugee Olympic Team also won their first-ever medal, a bronze in boxing. At the conclusion of the games, despite some controversies throughout relating to politics, logistics and conditions in the Olympic Village, the Games were considered a success by the press, Parisians and observers.[a] The Paris Olympics broke all-time records for ticket sales, with more than 9.5 million tickets sold (12.1 million including the Paralympic Games).[15]

Medals
Medals from the Games, with a piece of the Eiffel Tower
The President of the Paris 2024 Olympic Organizing Committee, Tony Estanguet, unveiled the Olympic and Paralympic medals for the Games in February 2024, which on the obverse featured embedded hexagon-shaped tokens of scrap iron that had been taken from the original construction of the Eiffel Tower, with the logo of the Games engraved into it.[41] Approximately 5,084 medals would be produced by the French mint Monnaie de Paris, and were designed by Chaumet, a luxury jewellery firm based in Paris.[42]

The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, inside the Panathenaic Stadium which hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896. Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower can also be seen in the background on both sides of the medal.[43] Each medal weighs 455–529 g (16–19 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 9.2 mm (0.36 in) thick.[44] The gold medals are made with 98.8 percent silver and 1.13 percent gold, while the bronze medals are made up with copper, zinc, and tin.[45]

Opening ceremony
Main article: 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony

Pyrotechnics at the Pont d'Austerlitz marking the start of the Parade of Nations

The cauldron flying above the Tuileries Garden during the games. LEDs and aerosol produced the illusion of fire, while the Olympic flame itself was kept in a small lantern nearby
The opening ceremony began at 19:30 CEST (17:30 GMT) on 26 July 2024.[124] Directed by Thomas Jolly,[125][126][127] it was the first Summer Olympics opening ceremony to be held outside the traditional stadium setting (and the second ever after the 2018 Youth Olympic Games one, held at Plaza de la República in Buenos Aires); the parade of athletes was conducted as a boat parade along the Seine from Pont d'Austerlitz to Pont d'Iéna, and cultural segments took place at various landmarks along the route.[128] Jolly stated that the ceremony would highlight notable moments in the history of France, with an overall theme of love and "shared humanity".[128] The athletes then attended the official protocol at Jardins du Trocadéro, in front of the Eiffel Tower.[129] Approximately 326,000 tickets were sold for viewing locations along the Seine, 222,000 of which were distributed primarily to the Games' volunteers, youth and low-income families, among others.[130]

The ceremony featured music performances by American musician Lady Gaga,[131] French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, heavy metal band Gojira and soprano Marina Viotti [fr],[132] Axelle Saint-Cirel (who sang the French national anthem "La Marseillaise" atop the Grand Palais),[133] rapper Rim'K,[134] Philippe Katerine (who portrayed the Greek god Dionysus), Juliette Armanet and Sofiane Pamart, and was closed by Canadian singer Céline Dion.[132] The Games were formally opened by president Emmanuel Macron.[135]

The Olympics and Paralympics cauldron was lit by Guadeloupean judoka Teddy Riner and sprinter Marie-José Pérec; it had a hot air balloon-inspired design topped by a 30-metre-tall (98 ft) helium sphere, and was allowed to float into the air above the Tuileries Garden at night. For the first time, the cauldron was not illuminated through combustion; the flames were simulated by an LED lighting system and aerosol water jets.[136]

Controversy ensued at the opening ceremony when a segment was interpreted by some as a parody of the Last Supper. The organisers apologised for any offence caused.[137] The Olympic World Library and fact-checkers would later debunk the interpretation that the segment was a parody of the Last Supper. The Olympic flag was also raised upside down.[138][139]

During the day of the opening ceremony, there were reports of a blackout in Paris, although this was later debunked.[140]

The ceremony and final fireworks
Main article: 2024 Summer Olympics closing ceremony
The closing ceremony was held at Stade de France on 11 August 2024, and thus marked the first time in any Olympic edition since Sarajevo 1984 that opening and closing ceremonies were held in different locations.[127] Titled "Records", the ceremony was themed around a dystopian future, where the Olympic Games have disappeared, and a group of aliens reinvent it. It featured more than a hundred performers, including acrobats, dancers and circus artists.[158] American actor Tom Cruise also appeared with American performers Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and H.E.R. during the LA28 Handover Celebration portion of the ceremony.[159][160] The Antwerp Ceremony, in which the Olympic flag was handed to Los Angeles, the host city of the 2028 Summer Olympics, was produced by Ben Winston and his studio Fulwell 73.[161]

Security
France reached an agreement with Europol and the UK Home Office to help strengthen security and "facilitate operational information exchange and international law enforcement cooperation" during the Games.[46] The agreement included a plan to deploy more drones and sea barriers to prevent small boats from crossing the Channel illegally.[47] The British Army would also provide support by deploying Starstreak surface-to-air missile units for air security.[48] To prepare for the Games, the Paris police held inspections and rehearsals in their bomb disposal unit, similar to their preparations for the 2023 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France.[49]

As part of a visit to France by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, several agreements were signed between the two nations to enhance security for the Olympics.[50] In preparation for the significant security demands and counterterrorism measures, Poland pledged to contribute security troops, including sniffer dog handlers, to support international efforts aimed at ensuring the safety of the Games.[51][52] The Qatari Minister of Interior and Commander of Lekhwiya (the Qatari security forces) convened a meeting on 3 April 2024 to discuss security operations ahead of the Olympics, with officials and security leaders in attendance, including Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Sheikh Jassim bin Mansour Al Thani.[53] A week before the opening ceremony, the Lekhwiya were reported to have been deployed in Paris on 16 July 2024.[54]

In the weeks running up to the opening of the Paris Olympics, it was reported that police officers would be deployed from Belgium,[55] Brazil,[56] Canada (through the RCMP/OPP/CPS/SQ),[57][58][59] Cyprus,[60] the Czech Republic,[61] Denmark,[62] Estonia,[63][64] Finland,[65] Germany (through Bundespolizei[66][67]/NRW Police[68]),[69] India,[70][71] Ireland,[72] Italy,[73] Luxembourg,[74] Morocco,[75] Netherlands,[76] Norway,[58] Poland,[77] Portugal,[78] Slovakia,[79] South Korea,[80][81] Spain (through the CNP/GC),[82] Sweden,[83] the UAE,[84] the UK,[49] and the US (through the LAPD,[85] LASD,[86] NYPD,[87] and the Fairfax County Police Department[88]), with more than 40 countries providing police assistance to their French counterparts.[89][90]

Security concerns impacted the plans that had been announced for the opening ceremony, which was to take place as a public event along the Seine; the expected attendance was reduced by half from an estimated 600,000 to 300,000, with plans for free viewing locations now being by invitation only. In April 2024, after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack in March, and made several threats against the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, French president Emmanuel Macron indicated that the opening ceremony could be scaled back or re-located if necessary.[91][92][93] French authorities had placed roughly 75,000 police and military officials on the streets of Paris in the lead-up to the Games.[94]

Following the end of the Games, the national counterterrorism prosecutor, Olivier Christen, revealed that French authorities foiled three terror plots meant to attack the Olympic and Paralympic Games, resulting in the arrest of five suspects.[95]

With the search function above, we can now automatically retrieve relevant knowledge and insert it into messages to GPT.
Below, we define a function ask that:

Takes a user query
Searches for text relevant to the query
Stuffs that text into a message for GPT
Sends the message to GPT
Returns GPT’s answer

def num_tokens(text: str, model: str = GPT_MODELS[0]) -> int:
    """Return the number of tokens in a string."""
    encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)
    return len(encoding.encode(text))

Example questions
Finally, let’s ask our system our original question about gold medal curlers:
ask('Which athletes won the gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics?')
"The athletes who won the gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics are:\n\n- Men's tournament: Niklas Edin, Oskar Eriksson, Rasmus Wranå, Christoffer Sundgren, and Daniel Magnusson from Sweden.\n- Women's tournament: Eve Muirhead, Vicky Wright, Jennifer Dodds, Hailey Duff, and Mili Smith from Great Britain.\n- Mixed doubles tournament: Stefania Constantini and Amos Mosaner from Italy."
With latest model and using embedding search, our search system was able to retrieve reference text for the model to read, allowing it to correctly list the gold medal winners in the Men’s and Women’s tournaments.
Troubleshooting wrong answers
In case we get any mistakes in the output, we can see whether a mistake is from a lack of relevant source text (i.e., failure of the search step) or a lack of reasoning reliability (i.e., failure of the ask step), you can look at the text GPT was given by setting print_message=True.
In this particular case, looking at the text below, it looks like the #1 article given to the model did contain medalists for all three events, but the later results emphasized the Men’s and Women’s tournaments, which may have distracted the model from giving a more complete answer.
# set print_message=True to see the source text GPT was working off of
ask('Which athletes won the gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics?', print_message=True)
Use the below articles on the 2022 Winter Olympics to answer the subsequent question. If the answer cannot be found in the articles, write "I could not find an answer."

Question: Which athletes won the gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics?
"The athletes who won the gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics are:\n\n- Men's tournament: Niklas Edin, Oskar Eriksson, Rasmus Wranå, Christoffer Sundgren, and Daniel Magnusson from Sweden.\n- Women's tournament: Eve Muirhead, Vicky Wright, Jennifer Dodds, Hailey Duff, and Mili Smith from Great Britain.\n- Mixed doubles tournament: Stefania Constantini and Amos Mosaner from Italy."
Knowing that sometimes, this mistake can be due to imperfect reasoning in the ask step, than imperfect retrieval in the search step, one can focus on improving the ask step.
The easiest way to improve results is to use a more capable models, such as GPT-4o-mini or GPT-4o models. Let’s try it.
ask('Which athletes won the gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics?', model=GPT_MODELS[1])
"The gold medal in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics was won by the following athletes:\n\n- Men's tournament: Niklas Edin, Oskar Eriksson, Rasmus Wranå, Christoffer Sundgren, Daniel Magnusson from Sweden.\n- Women's tournament: Eve Muirhead, Vicky Wright, Jennifer Dodds, Hailey Duff, Mili Smith from Great Britain.\n- Mixed doubles: Stefania Constantini and Amos Mosaner from Italy."
GPT-4 models tend to succeed, correctly identifying all 12 gold medal winners in curling.
More examples
Below are a few more examples of the system in action. Feel free to try your own questions, and see how it does. In general, search-based systems do best on questions that have a simple lookup, and worst on questions that require multiple partial sources to be combined and reasoned about.
# counting question

'There were 2 world records and 24 Olympic records set at the 2022 Winter Olympics.'

"Jamaica had more athletes at the 2022 Winter Olympics. Jamaica's team consisted of seven athletes. There is no information provided about Cuba's participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, so I cannot determine the number of athletes they had, if any."

ask("How did COVID-19 affect the 2022 Winter Olympics?")
"COVID-19 had a significant impact on the 2022 Winter Olympics in several ways:\n\n1. **Qualification Changes**: The pandemic led to changes in the qualification process for sports like curling and women's ice hockey due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event, while the IIHF used existing world rankings for women's ice hockey.\n\n2. **Biosecurity Protocols**: The IOC announced strict biosecurity protocols, requiring all athletes to remain within a bio-secure bubble, undergo daily COVID-19 testing, and only travel to and from Games-related venues. Athletes who were not fully vaccinated or did not have a valid medical exemption had to quarantine for 21 days upon arrival.\n\n3. **Spectator Restrictions**: Initially, only residents of the People's Republic of China were allowed to attend as spectators. Later, ticket sales to the general public were canceled, and only limited numbers of spectators were admitted by invitation, making it the second consecutive Olympics closed to the general public.\n\n4. **NHL Withdrawal**: The National Hockey League (NHL) withdrew its players from the men's hockey tournament due to COVID-19 concerns and the need to make up postponed games.\n\n5. **Quarantine and Testing**: Everyone present at the Games had to use the My2022 mobile app for health reporting and COVID-19 testing records. Concerns about the app's security led some delegations to advise athletes to use burner phones and laptops.\n\n6. **Athlete Absences**: Some top athletes, considered medal contenders, were unable to travel to China after testing positive for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic. This included athletes like Austrian ski jumper Marita Kramer and Russian skeletonist Nikita Tregubov.\n\n7. **Complaints and Controversies**: There were complaints from athletes and team officials about quarantine conditions, including issues with food, facilities, and lack of training equipment. Some athletes expressed frustration over the testing process and quarantine management.\n\n8. **COVID-19 Cases**: A total of 437 COVID-19 cases were reported during the Olympics, with 171 cases among the protective bubble residents and 266 detected from airport testing. Despite strict containment efforts, the number of cases was only slightly lower than those reported during the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.\n\nOverall, COVID-19 significantly influenced the organization, participation, and experience of the 2022 Winter Olympics."
